Burritos contain **ingredients**. An ingredient is a file-like resource with a mime-type and, optionally, a scope or role.

This specification places no constraints on the file layout used for ingredients but strongly recommends they be placed in a `ingredients/` directory. It is further recommended that application-specific files be placed within a sub-directory under this.
